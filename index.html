        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Mahmoud Ahmad, and I am currently a first year Pre-Business student at the University of California Riverside. I am currently in my first quarter and am taking over 13 credits. School is all online, so I am also holding a job where I work about twenty-thirty hours a week. I am excellent at using my time wisely and I try to not waste my time doing unnecessary activities when I could be a lot more productive. I am currently enrolled in classes that will strengthen my business knowledge down the line throughout the rest of the four years of college and my future job. I plan on concentrating on information systems when I officially enter the School of Business at UCR. I feel as if concentrating on information systems will help me achieve my goal of working in the technology aspect of a business. Being able to hold knowledge in both business and technology will be extremely beneficial in a work setting.<br><br>

       I currently work at a local fast food restaurant as a Lead Trainer. Holding this title I am the one who is responsible for training new employees whenever they are hired. So far I have trained over ten people and they all have been very successful so far working at the restaurant. I also excel at customer service skills and know how to make a customer's experience pleasant and going smooth. Teamwork and working together is another important aspect of the job and it is crucial to be able to work in a team to efficiently move cars through the drive thru without making people wait for long times. I am also very good at multitasking and can often take orders on the headset, bag the food, and charge people all at the same time. It is important to be able to multi-task because you will often find times where you are by yourself with no co-workers to help you so you have to be able to move the cars all on your own. I have received many great reviews from customers and am continually moving up the ranks in the store. <br><br>

        Outside of work and school I am also very active in my community. I help out a lot at my younger sister's school, and hold great relationships with most of the teachers. Whenever I am free I find myself helping around some teachers classrooms by grading papers and helping gather materials for any project they have going on. I am also working to achieve certifications in IT to help myself get internships in the next couple of years before I go off into the workforce. Holding these certifications will help in creating a strong overall picture of myself and give me the training needed to succeed in a job where technology is prevalent.
